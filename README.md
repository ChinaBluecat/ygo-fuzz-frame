# ygo-fuzz-frame

An simple fuzz frame I use to fuzz test ygocore yo-gi-oh card game.

### 1. memory leak

Run ygocore.exe, you can get this game in the link below.

If you get a higher version program, you should change the VERSION patameter in extra_info.py.

Click the first button, witch means play with others.

Click the button '确定'. It will create a server thread in your local network with port==7911.

You should check your IP address, and change ygo_server_addr in leak_ygo.py.

Then just run leak_ygo.py

```sh
python3 leak_ygo.py
```
